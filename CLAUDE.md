# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- Always review project planning and architecture documents (e.g., PLANNING.md) at the start of a new task or conversation.
- Check the task list (e.g., TASK.md) before starting work. If your task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- Follow established naming conventions, file structures, and architectural patterns as described in project documentation.

ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- Avoid files longer than 500 lines. If a file grows too large, refactor by splitting it into smaller modules or helper files.
- Organize code into clearly separated modules or files, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Use clear and consistent import/include/require statements as appropriate for the language and project.

ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability
- Always create unit tests for new features (functions, classes, routes, etc.), using the preferred testing framework for the language.
- After updating any logic, review and update existing tests as needed.
- Place tests in a dedicated tests directory that mirrors the main code structure.
- For each feature, include at least:
  - One test for expected/typical use
  - One edge case test
  - One failure or error case test

âœ… Task Completion
- Mark completed tasks in the task list (e.g., TASK.md) immediately after finishing them.
- Add any new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to the task list under a "Discovered During Work" section.

ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions
- Follow the official or community style guide for the language in use (e.g., PEP8, Google Java Style, Airbnb JavaScript Style).
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files (e.g., camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase) as appropriate.
- Write clear, descriptive names for all identifiers; avoid unnecessary abbreviations.
- Indent code consistently (spaces or tabs as per project/language standard).
- Limit line length to 80â€“120 characters, depending on language norms.
- Use comments to explain non-obvious logic, intent, and complex algorithms.
- Write documentation comments for all public functions, classes, and modules.
- Group related code by feature or responsibility.
- Remove dead code and unused variables/functions promptly.
- Prefer immutability and pure functions where practical.
- Avoid deep nesting; refactor complex logic into smaller functions.
- Use version control best practices: small, focused commits with clear messages.
- Ensure code is understandable and maintainable by others.

ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability
- Update project documentation (e.g., README.md) when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- Comment non-obvious code and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, add inline comments explaining the "why," not just the "what."

ðŸ§  AI/Automation Behavior Rules
- Never assume missing context; ask questions if uncertain.
- Never invent or hallucinate libraries, functions, or APIsâ€”only use known, verified components.
- Always confirm file paths and module names exist before referencing them in code or documentation.
- Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed or if it is part of a documented task.

## Code Architecture

### Core Structure
This is a TypeScript SDK for the PUBG API with a service-oriented architecture:

**Main Client (`src/api/client.ts`)**
- `PubgClient` - Main entry point that orchestrates all services
- Provides unified access to all API endpoints through service instances
- Handles configuration and provides utility methods for cache and rate limiting

**HTTP Layer (`src/api/http-client.ts`)**
- `HttpClient` - Handles all HTTP communication with the PUBG API
- Implements rate limiting (10 requests/minute default)
- Provides automatic retries, caching, and error handling
- Uses axios for HTTP requests with custom interceptors

**Service Layer (`src/api/services/`)**
Each service corresponds to a major PUBG API endpoint:
- `PlayersService` - Player data and statistics
- `MatchesService` - Match details and history
- `SeasonsService` - Season information
- `LeaderboardsService` - Leaderboard data
- `SamplesService` - Sample data for testing
- `TelemetryService` - Match telemetry data

**Utilities (`src/utils/`)**
- `RateLimiter` - Token bucket rate limiting implementation
- `Cache` - Memory-based caching with TTL and size limits
- `Logger` - Debug logging with namespaces (`pubg-ts:*`)
- `AssetManager` - Unified asset management system with zero-latency access to all PUBG assets
- `MonitoringSystem` - Prometheus metrics collection and OpenTelemetry tracing
- `HealthChecker` - System health monitoring with memory, connectivity, and event loop checks
- `SecurityManager` - Input validation, sanitization, and threat detection

**Asset Management System (`src/utils/assets.ts`)**
The unified AssetManager provides comprehensive access to all PUBG assets:
- **Zero-latency performance**: Uses locally synced data by default (no network requests)
- **Full TypeScript type safety**: All asset IDs are typed with union types for IntelliSense
- **Enhanced search capabilities**: Fuzzy search, category filtering, and metadata enhancement
- **Complete asset coverage**: Items, vehicles, maps, seasons, survival titles, and dictionaries
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains async methods for legacy code
- **Auto-synced data**: Assets are synced from official PUBG repository via `scripts/sync-assets.ts`

**Type Definitions (`src/types/`)**
- Comprehensive TypeScript types for all API responses
- Organized by domain (players, matches, seasons, etc.)
- Includes common types and API configuration interfaces

**Error Handling (`src/errors/`)**
- Custom error classes for different API error scenarios
- `PubgApiError`, `PubgRateLimitError`, `PubgAuthenticationError`, etc.

### Key Design Patterns
- **Service Pattern**: Each API domain has its own service class
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive HttpClient and configuration
- **Caching Layer**: Transparent caching with configurable TTL
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to respect API limits
- **Error Mapping**: HTTP errors mapped to domain-specific error types
- **Asset Management**: User-friendly transformation of technical IDs to human-readable names and metadata

### Testing Strategy

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. **Run full test suite**: `npm test` - Ensure all 191 tests pass
2. **Check build**: `npm run build` - Automatically syncs assets and compiles
3. **Lint code**: `npm run lint` - Check for code quality issues

### When Adding New Features
1. **Update monitoring**: Add metrics to `src/utils/monitoring.ts` for new operations
2. **Add security validation**: Use `SecurityManager` for any user input processing
3. **Write tests**: Maintain test coverage - add unit tests in `tests/unit/`
4. **Update assets**: Run `npm run sync-assets` if working with PUBG asset data

### When Modifying Services
- **HTTP Client Integration**: All services use the shared `HttpClient` with automatic monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Throw appropriate error types from `src/errors/`
- **Caching**: Use the built-in cache for expensive operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect the shared rate limiter across all services

### Working with Assets
- **Local First**: Use `AssetManager` synchronous methods for zero-latency access
- **Type Safety**: All asset IDs have union types - use `ItemId`, `VehicleId`, `MapId`
- **Fuzzy Search**: Built-in search capabilities via `fuse.js` integration
- **Sync Required**: Run `npm run sync-assets` to update with latest PUBG data

### CLI Development
The CLI tool (`src/cli/`) provides scaffolding and asset management:
- **Commands**: Located in `src/cli/commands/` (scaffold, assets, setup)
- **Templates**: Project templates for different use cases (basic, advanced, bot)
- **Binary**: Available as `npx pubg-ts` after build

### Performance Considerations
- **Monitoring Built-in**: HTTP client automatically tracks all metrics
- **Caching Strategy**: TTL-based with size limits, check stats with `getCacheStats()`
- **Asset Performance**: Local assets preferred over network calls
- **Memory Management**: Health checker monitors memory usage and event loop

### Security Guidelines
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs must go through `SecurityManager`
- **API Key Protection**: Never log or expose API keys in error messages
- **Dependency Security**: Run `npm run security:check` before releases
- **Audit Compliance**: Use `npm run security:audit` for comprehensive security analysis

### Production Deployment
- **Health Monitoring**: Use `npm run health:check` to verify system status
- **Performance Testing**: Run `npm run perf:test` for load validation
- **Security Validation**: Run `npm run security:check` before deployment
- **Asset Sync**: Ensure assets are synced with `npm run sync-assets`
