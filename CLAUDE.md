# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

### ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Use the configured package manager** (npm, yarn, or pnpm) as specified in the project for all dependency management and script execution.

### ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For services/agents this looks like:
    - `agent.ts` - Main agent definition and execution logic
    - `tools.ts` - Tool functions used by the agent
    - `prompts.ts` - System prompts and templates
    - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages, absolute imports for external dependencies).
- **Use environment variables with proper typing** via `dotenv` and create a `config.ts` file with typed environment variable validation.

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Jest/Vitest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder or `__tests__` folders** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
- **Use proper TypeScript testing patterns** with typed test utilities and mocks.

### âœ… Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.

### ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions
- **Use TypeScript** as the primary language with strict type checking enabled.
- **Follow consistent formatting** using Prettier and ESLint configurations.
- **Use strict TypeScript configuration** with `strict: true` and appropriate compiler options.
- **Use Zod or similar for runtime validation** when dealing with external data.
- Use **Express.js/Fastify for APIs** and **Prisma/TypeORM** for database ORM if applicable.
- Write **JSDoc comments for every exported function** using the TSDoc style:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Brief summary of what the function does.
   *
   * @param param1 - Description of the parameter
   * @param param2 - Description of the parameter
   * @returns Description of what is returned
   * @throws {ErrorType} Description of when this error is thrown
   */
  export function example(param1: string, param2: number): Promise<Result> {
    // Implementation
  }
  ```

### ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `// Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.
- **Maintain type documentation** and ensure all public APIs have proper TypeScript types exported.

### ðŸ§  AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** â€“ only use known, verified npm packages and TypeScript/Node.js APIs.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- **Always use proper TypeScript types** - avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary and document why.
- **Check `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`** to understand the project's TypeScript configuration and available dependencies.

## Code Architecture

### Core Structure
This is a TypeScript SDK for the PUBG API with a service-oriented architecture:

**Main Client (`src/api/client.ts`)**
- `PubgClient` - Main entry point that orchestrates all services
- Provides unified access to all API endpoints through service instances
- Handles configuration and provides utility methods for cache and rate limiting

**HTTP Layer (`src/api/http-client.ts`)**
- `HttpClient` - Handles all HTTP communication with the PUBG API
- Implements rate limiting (10 requests/minute default)
- Provides automatic retries, caching, and error handling
- Uses axios for HTTP requests with custom interceptors

**Service Layer (`src/api/services/`)**
Each service corresponds to a major PUBG API endpoint:
- `PlayersService` - Player data and statistics
- `MatchesService` - Match details and history
- `SeasonsService` - Season information
- `LeaderboardsService` - Leaderboard data
- `SamplesService` - Sample data for testing
- `TelemetryService` - Match telemetry data

**Utilities (`src/utils/`)**
- `RateLimiter` - Token bucket rate limiting implementation
- `Cache` - Memory-based caching with TTL and size limits
- `Logger` - Debug logging with namespaces (`pubg-ts:*`)
- `AssetManager` - Unified asset management system with zero-latency access to all PUBG assets
- `MonitoringSystem` - Prometheus metrics collection and OpenTelemetry tracing
- `HealthChecker` - System health monitoring with memory, connectivity, and event loop checks
- `SecurityManager` - Input validation, sanitization, and threat detection

**Asset Management System (`src/utils/assets.ts`)**
The unified AssetManager provides comprehensive access to all PUBG assets:
- **Zero-latency performance**: Uses locally synced data by default (no network requests)
- **Full TypeScript type safety**: All asset IDs are typed with union types for IntelliSense
- **Enhanced search capabilities**: Fuzzy search, category filtering, and metadata enhancement
- **Complete asset coverage**: Items, vehicles, maps, seasons, survival titles, and dictionaries
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintains async methods for legacy code
- **Auto-synced data**: Assets are synced from official PUBG repository via `scripts/sync-assets.ts`

**Type Definitions (`src/types/`)**
- Comprehensive TypeScript types for all API responses
- Organized by domain (players, matches, seasons, etc.)
- Includes common types and API configuration interfaces

**Error Handling (`src/errors/`)**
- Custom error classes for different API error scenarios
- `PubgApiError`, `PubgRateLimitError`, `PubgAuthenticationError`, etc.

### Key Design Patterns
- **Service Pattern**: Each API domain has its own service class
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive HttpClient and configuration
- **Caching Layer**: Transparent caching with configurable TTL
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to respect API limits
- **Error Mapping**: HTTP errors mapped to domain-specific error types
- **Asset Management**: User-friendly transformation of technical IDs to human-readable names and metadata

### Testing Strategy

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. **Run full test suite**: `npm test` - Ensure all 191 tests pass
2. **Check build**: `npm run build` - Automatically syncs assets and compiles
3. **Lint code**: `npm run lint` - Check for code quality issues

### When Adding New Features
1. **Update monitoring**: Add metrics to `src/utils/monitoring.ts` for new operations
2. **Add security validation**: Use `SecurityManager` for any user input processing
3. **Write tests**: Maintain test coverage - add unit tests in `tests/unit/`
4. **Update assets**: Run `npm run sync-assets` if working with PUBG asset data

### When Modifying Services
- **HTTP Client Integration**: All services use the shared `HttpClient` with automatic monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Throw appropriate error types from `src/errors/`
- **Caching**: Use the built-in cache for expensive operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect the shared rate limiter across all services

### Working with Assets
- **Local First**: Use `AssetManager` synchronous methods for zero-latency access
- **Type Safety**: All asset IDs have union types - use `ItemId`, `VehicleId`, `MapId`
- **Fuzzy Search**: Built-in search capabilities via `fuse.js` integration
- **Sync Required**: Run `npm run sync-assets` to update with latest PUBG data

### CLI Development
The CLI tool (`src/cli/`) provides scaffolding and asset management:
- **Commands**: Located in `src/cli/commands/` (scaffold, assets, setup)
- **Templates**: Project templates for different use cases (basic, advanced, bot)
- **Binary**: Available as `npx pubg-ts` after build

### Performance Considerations
- **Monitoring Built-in**: HTTP client automatically tracks all metrics
- **Caching Strategy**: TTL-based with size limits, check stats with `getCacheStats()`
- **Asset Performance**: Local assets preferred over network calls
- **Memory Management**: Health checker monitors memory usage and event loop

### Security Guidelines
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs must go through `SecurityManager`
- **API Key Protection**: Never log or expose API keys in error messages
- **Dependency Security**: Run `npm run security:check` before releases
- **Audit Compliance**: Use `npm run security:audit` for comprehensive security analysis

### Production Deployment
- **Health Monitoring**: Use `npm run health:check` to verify system status
- **Performance Testing**: Run `npm run perf:test` for load validation
- **Security Validation**: Run `npm run security:check` before deployment
- **Asset Sync**: Ensure assets are synced with `npm run sync-assets`
