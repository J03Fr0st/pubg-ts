# Memory Maintenance

## Discovery Model

- Core principle: progressive discovery through references, building a graph of memories.
- Initially, agents are provided with the list of all memories (names only).
- Agents should read `mem:core` as the top-level entry point.
- Memory references must use a mem: prefix inside backticks, e.g. `mem:frontend/core`.
- Memories themselves should not contain information about when to read them; this is the responsibility of the referring memory.

## Style

Dense agent notes, not prose docs. Prefer invariants, terse bullets.
Avoid obvious context, rationale, and examples unless they prevent likely mistakes.
Keep guidance durable and generalizable, not task-local.

## Add/update threshold

Add or update memories only with stable, non-obvious project conventions that avoid complex rediscovery in the future.
Do not add: quick-read facts; generic language/framework knowledge; one-off task notes; volatile line-level details; behavior likely to change soon.

## Maintenance Actions

- Checking for stale memories: call `serena memories check` for a report.
